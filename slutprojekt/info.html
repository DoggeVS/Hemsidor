            <h3>Proboscis Monkeys</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Habitat and Behavior</dt>
                <dd>Proboscis monkeys are endemic to the jungles of Borneo, never straying far from the island’s rivers,
                    coastal mangroves, and swamps. They are a highly arboreal species and will venture onto land only
                    occasionally to search for food. They live in organized harem groups consisting of a dominant male
                    and two to seven females and their offspring. Various groups often congregate near water at night to
                    sleep.</dd>
                <dt>Swimming Abilities</dt>
                <dd>Proboscis monkeys are the primate world’s most prolific swimmers, frequently leaping from tree limbs
                    and hitting the water with a comical belly flop. They’ve evolved webbed feet and hands to help them
                    outpace the crocodiles that are some of their main predators.</dd>
                <dt>Size and Appearance</dt>
                <dd>Among the largest of Asia’s monkeys, male proboscis specimens can reach 50 pounds, although females
                    attain only about half that size. Adults wear a coat of light brown fur that turns red around the
                    head and shoulders and gray at the arms, legs, and tail. Only males develop the namesake nose.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Bald Uakari</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Appearance</dt>
                <dd>The Bald uakari is a South American primate with a rather unusual appearance. Thus, this animal
                    exhibits a bright red, wide and flat face. Another characteristic feature of this animal is its
                    extremely short tail. The Bald uakaris are believed to have developed this unique color pattern of
                    this face as a result of malaria, which is a common disease in their Amazon rainforest habitat:
                    those with bright red faces are considered to display healthiness, while those with paler faces have
                    definitely contracted malaria and lack the natural immunity to this disease. Hence, these sick
                    animals are typically left without mates.</dd>
                <dt>Habits and Lifestyle</dt>
                <dd>ald uakaris are highly social creatures, forming groups of 10 - 30 individuals, although these
                    primates have been observed in larger units of up to 100. When foraging, these groups divide into
                    smaller sub-groups of 1 - 10 animals. As diurnal animals, bald uakaris sleep during the nighttime
                    high in thin tree branches. They use all of their four legs, when walking and running both on the
                    ground and in trees. When bounding and jumping, they use only two legs. Bald uakaris communicate and
                    mark their home ranges through loud shrieking calls, although these animals are generally quiet.
                    Bald uakaris are not only intelligent, but also very active and playful animals. They spend a lot of
                    time playing various games, particularly young individuals.</dd>
                <dt>Mating Habits</dt>
                <dd>Bald uakaris are monogamous, which means that one male mates with one female exclusively. They
                    typically breed between October and May. Females yield a single baby after 6 month of gestation. The
                    newborn infant is helpless and very small. During the first few months of its life, the baby feed
                    exclusively upon maternal milk and is clung to its mother. At 3 - 5 months old, the infant starts
                    taking soft fruits and is subsequently weaned. Females of this species first mate at 3 years old,
                    whereas males start mating at 6 years of age.

            <h3>Tarsier</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Tarsiers Have Enormous Eyes</dt>
                <dd>Tarsiers have the largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. Each eyeball is around 16
                    millimeters in diameter, which is as large as the tarsier’s entire brain. The eyes are so large that
                    they can’t rotate them. Instead, tarsiers can twist their necks a full 180 degrees in either
                    direction, just like owls. They use this ability to wait silently for prey to approach, rather than
                    moving around to hunt.
                    The size of their eyes is likely related to the absence of a reflective layer called a tapetum
                    that's typically found on the eyes of other nocturnal animals.
                    Babies are born with their eyes open, ready to climb trees within an hour of birth.</dd>
                <dt>They Are Entirely Carnivorous</dt>
                <dd>Tarsiers are the only entirely carnivorous primate. While the specific diet varies with the species,
                    they all have one thing in common: they don’t eat plant matter of any kind. They feast on insects,
                    reptiles like lizards and snakes, frogs, birds, and even bats. They’re serious ambush predators,
                    waiting silently for prey to approach nearby—and can even snag birds and bats right out of the air.
                    Old texts, based on regional lore, reported that tarsiers eat charcoal. This report is untrue;
                    instead, the tarsiers dig through charcoal to reach bugs.</dd>
                <dt>They Have Elongated Appendages</dt>
                <dd>Tarsiers get their name from the extraordinarily elongated tarsus bones in their feet. While the
                    tarsier’s head and body are 4 to 6 inches in length, their hind legs and feet are twice as long.
                    They also have a long, usually hairless tail that adds an extra 8 or 9 inches. Their fingers are
                    extra long to help grasp tree branches, and their third finger is as long as their entire upper arm.
                    The tips of their digits can expand into disk-like adhesive pads that aid them in gripping.This
                    unique anatomy allows tarsiers to be vertical clingers and climbers—and jumpers. They can jump 40
                    times their body length in a single leap</dd>
