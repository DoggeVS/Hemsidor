            <h2>Interesting facts about monkeys</h2>
            <h3>Gorillas</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>There are two species of gorilla: eastern and western</dt>
                <dd>Each species splits into two groups, known as subspecies. The four gorilla subspecies are eastern
                    lowland gorillas, eastern mountain gorillas, western lowland gorillas, and western cross river
                    gorillas!</dd>
                <dt>Adult males are known as ‘silverbacks’</dt>
                <dd>These powerful males can be more than 10 times stronger than an average human – they can tear down
                    banana trees, bend iron bars and bite with more power than a lion! For the most part, though,
                    they’re gentle giants, only using their full strength when they feel threatened.</dd>
                <dt>Gorilla noseprints are as unique as human fingerprints!</dt>
                <dd>As a result, scientists can identify individual gorillas by paying close attention to the shape of
                    their nose. Unique scars or marks on their faces help, too!</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Chimpanzee</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>We Share 95 to 98 Percent of the Same DNA with Chimpanzees</dt>
                <dd>Biologically, we are much more closely related to chimpanzees and bonobos than we do to gorillas.
                    Our two species are descended from a single ancestor species that lived six or seven million years
                    ago.</dd>
                <dt>Chimpanzees Have the Ability to Learn Human Languages such as Sign Language</dt>
                <dd>In captivity, chimpanzees have been able to pick up American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate with
                    caretakers. A chimpanzee named Washoe, was known to be the first non-human to learn to communicate
                    via ASL and was able to do more than 350 signs. Washoe also managed to pass on some signs to her
                    adopted son later on.</dd>
                <dt>Chimpanzees are one of the Few Animals that are Known to Use Tools</dt>
                <dd>Much like humans, chimpanzees utilise self-made tools in order to feed and protect themselves, and
                    have found ingenious ways to do so. From using small branches to dig out termites from their mounds,
                    to smashing rocks to crack open nuts to searching the right length of twig to scratch themselves,
                    chimpanzees have real creativity in turning tools to their benefit. </dd>

            <h3>Golden snub-nosed monkey</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>They have beautiful reddish-gold fur all over</dt>
                <dd>Adult male and female golden snub-nosed monkeys have golden-orange foreheads, necks and stomachs.
                    The fur on their cape and back is reddish gold with a brown to dark brown tinge around the outer
                    arms, crown, nape, and thighs. All golden snub-nosed monkeys have a pale blue face, a large set of
                    teeth and a flat nose, and their tails are longer than their entire body length. The infants are not
                    born golden but brownish gray and gradually change color as they grow older.

                    Male golden snub-nosed monkeys weigh between 15 to 39 kilos, while females weigh around 7 to 10
                    kilos. They can grow up to 57-76 cm from head to body, and their tails are usually 51 to 72 cm long.
                    Males are naturally more muscular than females.</dd>
                <dt>Golden snub-nosed monkeys have many distinct features</dt>
                <dd>Their extremely short noses and beautiful reddish-gold fur are their most distinct features. Because
                    they live in severely cold regions, these primates have no use for a longer nose as it would be hard
                    to keep warm and may get frost-bitten.

                    Their thick, long fur covers every bit of their bodies, except around the eyes, nose and mouth,
                    while their hands are padded, looking like they’re wearing mittens. Throughout the year, their fur
                    changes. In spring, they shed and grow shorter hair to adjust to the warmer temperature of summer.
                    This fur is brownish gray, which helps them blend into the forest. In autumn, they molt again and
                    grow a thicker golden orange coat that gives warmth in winter.</dd>
                <dt>They are native only to China</dt>
                <dd>Native to China, golden snub-nosed monkeys dwell in the mountain of Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi, and the
                    Sichuan provinces, where the largest population has been sighted. They prefer the conifer forests
                    and deciduous broadleaf around the Tibetan plateau at elevations of 13,000 feet and are among the
                    few primates that reside in temperate zones. But in the height of winter, they climb down to
                    woodlands at lower altitudes where it’s easier to find food.</dd>
